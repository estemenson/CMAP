\begin{abstract}
The main goals of this project were to explore the use of multitouch enabled
surfaces and how this technology could be leveraged to create a new level of
usability in terms of human computer support of group collaboration in a design
process setting. Furthermore it was desirable to develop a fully functional
system that could be used to help in the design and maintenance of any type of
project. It was hoped that the process of developing such a system would deepen
our understanding of the complexities involved in preserving and enhancing the
human communication needs in a complex computer supported
environment.\emph{abstract} environment.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scope}
This project focuses on two particular aspects of Agile software engineering,
the user storycard and the cardwall. Both are physical artefacts used in
traditional pen and paper type, Agile planning meetings. They support
lightweight processes used for estimating and planning throughout the entire
life cycle of a project. They have proven to be critical to the success of many
projects, viz. “The technique of expressing requirements as user stories is one
of the most broadly applicable techniques introduced by the Agile processes”
\cite{StoriesRequ}. The cardwall acts as an Information Radiator \cite{InfoRad} 
that is on constant display, is intended to be used in a public place where 
information is gathered and where discussion is encouraged.

\subsection{Motivation}
Previous attempts to digitise this Agile software design process have fallen
short, mainly due to the paradigm in which they were developed. These tools have
been designed for the traditional single input, one device at a time, type
computer and therefore have failed to capture the flexibility and simplicity
afforded by pen and paper, in many respects losing the human factors that ensure
that the process works e.g., ``every attempt I’ve seen to computerise stories
has failed to provide a fraction of the value of having real cards on a real
wall" \cite{XPvol2}. For these reasons, lightweight tools for software design and
development were chosen as the domain for this project. In particular, the
project explores tools designed to leverage the advances in the latest
multitouch capable digital tables and walls. These advances are the key to
developing truly innovative, intuitive user interfaces for the purpose of
designing and maintaining Agile software projects.
Of particular interest is the exploration of these new technologies and how they
can be harnessed by developers to create new tools for the design process. Tools
that can realistically replace traditional paper based activities must adopt a
value-added philosophy where the tool makes no attempt to replace the human
users, rather, its aim should be to co-exist or facilitate the process, ensuring
that human factors inherent in the activity are preserved. Of utmost importance
in accomplishing this task is the true understanding of what makes these
lightweight processes so successful. In fact the cognitive and social aspects of
the process are fundamental to these systems and if the tools are not designed
with this in mind they will never hope to completely replace their pen and paper
counterparts. \cite{Sharp}

\subsection{Method}
Keeping this in mind, the goal of this project was to create a tool to support
Agile software design methodologies. In particular we wanted to create a tool
that could digitise the traditional use of the Agile storycard and cardwall
using a multitouch enabled surface.

As touched upon previously, the exploration of the possibilities that the latest
in multitouch enabled hardware devices afford was, at least as important as the
final software package itself. Along with these new devices are a plethora of
options available to develop multitouch applications. Everything from open
source frameworks, Dot Net libraries and proprietary industry API’s; from which
we choose to leverage the power of the open source community and the Python
programming language where we found an excellent framework named PyMT, a
framework designed for the rapid development of multitouch UI prototypes.

\subsection{Research Question}
Using this framework we wanted to see what kinds of new interfaces we could
create that would enable the implementation of this software in a way that
current users of these methodologies could transparently transition from their
paper world to our digital counterpart. The idea was to create a digital
storycard application for multitouch surfaces that would encourage a
communicative Agile approach. The software should provide development teams with
a useful collaborative tool for both co-located and geographically dispersed
teams; ultimately facilitating a rapid and efficient design and development
process. \section{Background}
\subsection{Agile Methodology}
Today, many lightweight Agile processes have emerged, however, for the purpose
of this paper we consider the two most common, Extreme Programming \cite{XPvol}
and Scrum \cite{Scrum}. Both of these methodologies take an iterative approach
where less focus is put on upfront analysis and more on quick consistent
deployment of quality working software. One important difference between these
two methodologies is the point at which the software is actually released to the
customer and the distinction between XP’s iterations and Scrum’s sprints. In
Extreme Programming, working software is delivered to the customer at the end of
every iteration, typically a one or two week cycle. In Scrum, the completion of
each sprint signifies that there is working software that is ready to be
released to the customer but does not have to be; a sprint typically lasts about
one month. Keeping this in mind, the two terms are quite similar and this report
will use the terms interchangeably. Figure \ref{XPWaterfallScrum} compares a two
year project using XP, the traditional waterfall and Scrum methodologies. Notice
the biggest difference is the number of deliverables. The storycard and cardwall
are physical artefacts that help support lightweight Agile processes. The
storycard (see Figure \ref{Storycard}) and the cardwall (see Figure
\ref{Cardwall}) are tools designed to help in the gathering of requirements,
prioritization and scheduling of work as well a means to quickly amass critical
information about the state of the project in a very public and transparent way.
More importantly when used correctly they are the catalyst of communication
between not only team members but also customers and other stakeholders. Initial
relations between customer and developer are made when stories are first
created, and continue as they are prioritized, scheduled and most importantly
during active development. The wall on the other hand acts as an Information
Radiator \cite{InfoRad} and is invaluable in terms of the information that can
be gathered at a glance. The wall quickly reveals whether or not a project is on
schedule or falling behind. It conveys the progression of stories as they are
physically moved to different locations. It can also be easily organized in a
manner to show work completed, bugs, and work yet to be scheduled.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Traditional User Storycards} 
The storycard is a physical artefact usually similar in size to an index card,
postcard or even a sticky-note. Typically, customers use storycards to record
user stories. Stories use customer centric language to define features and
requirements. The size of the storycard is deliberately small, preventing
unnecessary verbose detail, “The Card may be the most visible manifestation of a
user story, but it is not the most important.” \cite{PowerStories}. Davies
continues to explain that cards “represent customer requirements rather than
document them.” This emphasises that the actual text on the card is simply a
reminder or placeholder while “the details are worked out in the Conversation
and recorded in the Confirmation.” \cite{UserStoriesApplied} In the process of
creating stories the following should be considered, “Words, especially when
written, are a very thin medium through which to express requirements for
something as complex as software. With their ability to be misinterpreted we
need to replace written words with frequent conversations between developers,
customers, and users. User stories provide us with a way of having just enough
written down that we don't forget and that we can estimate and plan while also
encouraging this time of communication.” \cite{UserStoriesApplied} Jeffries
describes the procedure as the combination of the three C’s, Card, Conversation
and Confirmation \cite{Jeffries}. The process starts with the assignment of a
story to a developer; “the physical possession of this card by a developer is a
warrant that secures the conversation (and the confirmation process of the
acceptance test) with a customer”\cite{Sharp}. The subsequent communication
between developer and customer explores the details of the story and the
confirmation, should be mutually agreed upon, such that the story’s completion
is well understood.
\subsection{Traditional use of the Agile Cardwall}
The cardwall is typically used as a tool for the initial design and project
management process and subsequently to re-organize, prioritize and manage new
developments in an Agile project. The most common use tends to adhere to the
following pattern; a project backlog (a collection of stories) is created which
ultimately defines the scope of the project. Depending on the exact methodology
used, initially as many stories as possible will be created in an attempt to get
a complete view of the system and all of its requirements, or possibly only
sufficient stories to get the project started. The physical representation of a
backlog is a stack of cards on a table or a collection of sticky-notes on a
wall. The stories in the project backlog are organized and prioritized into
releases and sprints. A release is simply the term used to describe a
deliverable working piece of code. It typically marks a milestone in the
development of the product denoting that sufficient key features have been
implemented and tested. Sprints are simply a cycle which is made up of a
development phases and a retrospective phase. A sprint is a small unit of work
typically lasting from one week to one month. The priorities assigned to the
stories dictate which sprint they will be assigned to and thus when they will be
implemented. At the end of each sprint there is a sprint retrospective which is
where the progress is gauged, the process is analyzed and a general
determination as to the overall health of the project is made. The sprint
retrospective is the chance to learn from mistakes and correct them before they
become a permanent part of the process. Figure \ref{AgileProcess} shows the 
basic workflow from a collection of stories in the backlog, to the selection of 
the most important stories for the sprint, to the actual development cycle or 
sprint and finally to the working piece of software which may or may not be 
delivered to the customer. This process is essentially repeated until the last 
sprint is done and the product backlog is empty.\begin{figure}[htp]

\end{center}
\end{figure}
The cardwall will typically remain on display in a public area for the duration of the project so as to facilitate the rapid modification of stories, sprints 
and releases, due to changing requirements or priorities. Artefacts can simply 
be rearranged or completely removed, based on the new requirements. A natural 
question might be to wonder how this level of detail and complexity can be 
captured on a few cue cards pinned to a wall, and, maybe more importantly, how 
does this cardwall actually help software development teams to meet their goals 
and deadlines while producing quality code? Often, it is that human component 
that is the key to the success of the method. Any software trying to replace a 
physical task must consider this issue in depth and try and provide an 
environment, which supports and encourages those same interactions, which bring 
success to the physical task; “Any Agile team looking to move towards digitising
the team’s support will need to take account of the complex relationships that 
exist within this social system if they wish to retain key properties of 
successful teams.” \cite{Sharp}.
\subsection{Related Work}
There are a limited number of software design tools developed to harness the new
possibilities in Human Computer Interaction afforded by the current technology
in multitouch enabled devices such as digital tables and walls. The technology,
although not new, is still in flux and continuously improving. Everyday more
devices are being produced at a reasonable cost with support for two or more
simultaneous touches; a critical feature for the development of truly
collaborative tools. The best example of similar software is the Agile Planner
for Digital Tabletop (APDT), \cite{Wang}. APDT was designed based on a prototype
by Weber \cite{Webber} which was intended for
co-located collaboration on a single touch surface. APDT chose to use this as a
starting point but wanted to enhance it with support for multitouch, the ability
to interface with other Agile planning tools and real world evaluation based on
user studies; observing traditional Agile planning meetings as well as planning
meetings conducted using DAP or Distributed AgilePlanner \cite{DAP}
As the name suggests DAP was designed to support distributed Agile teams in the 
planning and maintenance of an Agile project through the use of a digital 
whiteboard and storycards. Support for stories, their creation, deletion and 
manipulation as well as support for the digital wall where stories could be 
prioritized, assigned and scheduled. Finally, Dap also included visualizations 
using the whiteboard to quickly gather progress type information. Dap had been 
developed with a traditional single user interface paradigm (one keyboard, one 
mouse) such that users could collaborate from a distance but not so much in a 
co-located environment. APDT also studied and drew from the literature available
on the use of multitouch tabletops in a collaborative but not necessarily Agile 
manner. APDT was developed as a multitouch enabled tool, specifically for two 
tables designed by Smart Technologies Ltd (Smart), using Smart’s proprietary
SDK.  The first table used DViT (Digital Vision Touch) technology and had 
support for two concurrent touches. The second table used FTIR (Frustrated Total
Internal Reflection) technology and had support for 40 concurrent touches. The 
two touch capabilities of the DViT table limited the user’s ability to work 
concurrently while the small form factor of the FTIR table meant that it was 
difficult to leverage its support for 40 simultaneous touches; since, only four 
adults could comfortably and concurrently interact with the table. APDT was a 
highly functional full featured tool, however, its dependence on the Smart SDK
and therefore on Smart’s hardware helped us make a key design decision; we
wanted CMAP to be designed such that hardware and operating system independence
was a goal, as well as support for multiple concurrent touches.
\subsection{Theory}
\subsubsection{Why are physical storycards and walls so effective?}
The following is a summary of some key points from the paper “The role of
physical artefacts in Agile software development: Two complementaryperspectives” \cite{Sharp} While a general templatefor stories usually exists such that key information is usually present like the
‘As A<Role>’, ‘I want <Description>, and ‘So that <Benefit>’, the process is
extremely flexible and we commonly find distinct notation across Agile teams. At
the same time within any one team the notation and use of cards is strictly
adhered to. Everything on the card has meaning which is not necessarily clear to
an observer unfamiliar with the team specific notation. The location of, color,
size of lettering and any annotations carry significant meaning and thus provide
a high level of abstraction. A mature established team might have a well-defined
notation while a new team might still be looking for what works best for them
but the beauty of the physical cards is that they don’t restrict a team to any
one notation; thus teams are free to find their ideal solution.

The use of the wall is also an extremely flexible procedure but, has it’s
generalities in that, teams use walls for the duration of a project and leave
them on constant display somewhere they are easily seen, usually, in a common
space where anyone walking by could get an idea of the progress of the team. The
wall is generally regarded as an “Information Radiator” \cite{InfoRad} and helps
ensure the transparency of the project. Again, the wall is full of meaning not
obvious to an observer who lacks familiarity with Agile methodologies or team
specific notation. The key information that you should be able to gather almost
instantaneously from any wall is the general progress of the project.  The
placement of stories signifies whether or not they are in active development,
waiting to be started, finished etc. Again the wall is generally without
structure when considering its use among distinct teams, but it is used in an
extremely consistent manner within any one team.

Using cardwalls requires an active participation between customers and
developers and was originally described as “The Planning Game”, \cite{XPvol}
where the objective, basically would be, to prioritize the cards, sort them into
releases and sprints, assign them to developers and have the developers accept
or decline them until the cards were sufficiently sorted into at least the next
sprint; while unassigned stories are left in the project backlog, to be dealt
with at the next iteration or release planning meeting.

Maybe more importantly are the social interactions involved in the whole
process; enabling teams to determine their best use of notation, annotation and
layout. These interactions reveal the importance and meaning of the stories and
thus drive their physical placement on wall, which, in turn drives the story’s
progress through the system. The physical size of the cards is also of utmost
importance since it limits the information it can hold and therefore encourages
a communicative dialog.
\subsubsection{Digital Collaborative Workspaces}
An important paper describing system guidelines for co-located collaborative
work on a tabletop display, finds that there are eight key elements that must be
addressed via the physical hardware of the tabletop, via the software being used
on the tabletop or by a combination of the two \cite{ScottGuidelines}. The
following is a summary of those key requirements and a brief description of
each.
\subparagraph{Support interpersonal interaction}
The technology must support the mediation of the collaborative interaction and
must not interfere with this interaction. Ideally it should be as natural to
collaborate around a digital tabletop as it is to collaborate around a regular
table. \subparagraph{Support for fluid Transitions between Activities} Switching
tasks during collaboration should be as seamless as possible. For example, if
the activity needs to combine data entry and the ability to draw, then switching
between these activities must be a natural process. This allows the focus to
remain on communication. The use of multiple input mechanisms must be considered
but, should be a feature that enhances the overall activity and not a hindrance
for these transitions. \subparagraph{Support for Transitions between Personal
and Group Work} If the collaborative task involves a combination of both
personal and group work, the system should try and capture this by providing a
similar mechanism. The physical shape of the table might be a key factor for
this point because the individuals must feel comfortable and their personal
workspace must not feel cramped or invaded. One suggestion may be to support
external devices or displays that could be used in conjunction with the shared
workspace of the digital tabletop. This approach may however, interfere with the
fluid collaboration Scott suggests that this area needs more study.
\subparagraph{Support Transitions between Tabletop Collaboration and External
Work} It should be easy to integrate previous work performed on an external
device such as a laptop. If the activity requires that the participants have
personal work (created elsewhere) that should be shared and or discussed; that
work in whatever form it takes should be accessible to be viewed or manipulated
in the shared workspace. \subparagraph{Support the use of Physical Objects} The
system should support both the use of external objects related to the task as
well as items that are non-work related. For example there should be no negative
impact on the system if a cup were to be placed on the digital tabletop.
Furthermore it would be desirable if the system could differentiate between
work-related and non-work related objects such that, that same cup, being placed
in a way that obscured critical information might cause the system to react by
redrawing the obscured part of the screen in a slightly different position.
\subparagraph{Provide Shared Access to Physical and Digital Objects} While
collaborating around a traditional table, pointing and other gestures are
usually easily interpreted by the group. On a digital surface this may not
always be the case. A digital tabletop may provide several representations of
the shared object (maybe one for each person) using gestures to try and point
something out in this scenario could lead to confusion as users are force to
interpret how the gesture may apply to their copy of the object. If however only
one representation of the object is present, those same gestures may be a
contributing factor to the overall understanding and group collaboration. The
digital representation of shared objects is a key to the successfulness of the
collaborative session. The designers must consider the potential physical
locations of the participants as well as the possibility of obstruction by other
users, objects or even gestures. Obvious examples of physical objects are
digital artefacts like an IPad. Another good example of physical artefacts might
be the pieces or tokens of a board game implemented for the table top. The
system could be designed such that it supported real game pieces to be shared
and interacted with throughout the course of play.
\subparagraph{Considerations for the Appropriate Arrangements of Users}
People are generally more comfortable when they feel like their personal space
is not invaded or at least not for a prolonged period of time. The system must
be designed to accommodate this and allow users to comfortably interact with
each other. Also, the intended audience is important because the physical
difference between adults and children suggest that more children may
comfortably interact around a table since they are physically smaller, let alone
the child’s tendency to want to be in closer proximity to their neighbours then
most adults \cite{Aiello}. The system should also not be affected by
participants repositioning themselves around the table. Virtual objects
displayed on the table should be rotatable such that from anywhere around the
table a participant could manipulate the object so as to get a more
understandable view. \subparagraph{Support Simultaneous User Actions} This point
is critical to any collaborative system and one area where true hardware and
software advancements have developed since the publication of Scott’s paper in
2003. Current tabletop implementations support both multiple input devices and
concurrent user input. \section{Design} CMAP, A Collaborative Multitouch Agile
Planner was primarily, a project intended to create software designed
specifically to digitise the storycard and cardwall; thereby facilitating the
planning and management of the software development process of Agile development
teams. One of the driving forces behind the project was the exploration of
multitouch in terms of the specific advantages it brings to help system
developers create interfaces that enrich group collaboration for the purposes of
designing software with an Agile approach. During the implementation and testing
of the initial system it became clear that there were flaws that needed to be
addressed. These issues gave birth to a new design and consequently a second
version of CMAP. In this section a discussion of the general design goals
relevant to both versions will be outlined, followed by the specific design of
each version and the reasons for the change. Finally, an attempt will be made to
outline specific design elements that targeted particular aspects of Scott’s
guidelines for group collaboration around digital tabletops. \subsection{Basic
Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Support for Agile design methodologies and processes. In particular, the
use of Storycards and the cardwall were essential.
\item Support multiple inputs.
\item Support multiple surfaces. The system should be platform independent.
\item Support concurrent multiple user interaction.
\item Support the use of gestures.
\item Support the orientation independent use of the system.
\item Support for persistent data.
\item Support for shared data.
\end{itemize}
To support these goals several design decisions were made including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The decision to use PyMT multitouch framework and therefore the Python  
  programming language meant built in platform independence, multiple concurrent
  user interaction and support for multiple inputs. The PyMT framework allowed
  the use of gestures and rotatable widgets to deal with orientation issues.
  Furthermore, since both Python and PyMT are open source, we had the access and
  the freedom to change the code base if we found the need.  \item The need to support persistent and shared data was achieved by using a  
  combination of open source projects including Git, GitHub and Petaapan’s
  Google Application Server. This allowed for local storage of data that could
  be pushed to the GitHub server which would in turn request that the Google App
  Server notify its clients that new data was available to be pulled on GitHub.
  This process applied the publish subscribe design pattern.
  \item The Model View Controller pattern was used extensively as well as the
  Strategy pattern. These patterns allowed for view independence and for 
  pluggable controllers which gave access to the models which were simple XML 
  DOM objects. The use of the Document Object Model, XML  and python’s 
  introspection allowed for the real time addition of member variables to 
  individual artefacts.(see Appendix C: Example XML Story Template)
  \item Through the use of command line options or a configuration file, the
  system was designed to work in many modes. This allows it to be used 
  standalone in offline mode or individual components could be enabled to allow 
  for full point to point data sharing or some subset. The key components that 
  can be enabled or disabled are the use of the local repository, the GitHub 
  server and the Google App Server. If all these features are enabled then data 
  can be shared between remote copies of the application.(see Appendix B: 
  Configuration file)
\end{itemize}
The use of gestures was an important feature and a unique gesture was provided as a shortcut to all of the most important activities allowed by the CMAP. The PyMT framework has built support for the use of standard gestures into many of their widgets, however, CMAP needed the ability to use new gestures no defined by PyMT. Figure \ref{Gestures}, is a list of these custom gestures and a brief
description.

\end{figure}
\par
Key decisions related to the support of Agile methodologies
\begin{itemize}
  \item The wall traditionally gives structure to the stories and helps
  developers organise and manage their projects. To capture this functionality a
  hierarchical structure was created and the concept of type and a parent, child
  relationship was conceived for the artefacts. The idea behind this design
  decision was that artefacts could represent a project, a release, a sprint, a
  story or a task. Depending on its type, an artefact could have zero or more
  parents as well as zero or more children. 
  \item The ability to group similar artefacts was considered important and the
  concept of a container was developed to be able to flip through different
  artefacts of the same type. This gives the system the ability to see for
  example all the releases in a project or all the stories in a sprint  (see
  Figure \ref{Coverflow1}, Figure \ref{Coverflow2} and Figure \ref{Coverflow3}
  for an illustration of how to flip through the contents of a coverflow
  widget).  \item A global backlog was needed to contain unclassified artefacts that had  
   no relation to a parent artefact. For example the creation of a story that
  was   not part of any sprint, release or project would be placed in this
  backlog.\end{itemize}

\subsection{Version 1 Design Strategy}
This version took a structured approach to the Storycard and cardwall. This was
an attempt to capture all the relevant data that seemed to be critical to the
Agile planning process. XML was used to define the data of the Storycards and
other artefacts and the view was a form based widget with labels and text
fields.  Users could use traditional data entry via real or virtual keyboards.
In an attempt to limit the amount of information contained by an artefact, a
default minimal view was created which only allowed the entry of a name for the
artefact and a description. Figure \ref{Minstory} shows the minimal artefact
view.
\paragraph{}

  \caption[labelInTOC]{Structured Minimal Storycard View}
  \label{Minstory}
%\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par
A second view was created for stories to allow the user to enter more 
information. This view was built so that the developer could, in conversation 
with the customer, elaborate on the information provided by the minimal view. 
Figure \ref{Fullstory} shows this more detailed view of a Storycard.

This structured approach seemed like a good way to capture the data and have it
in a format that could easily be stored, shared and adapted to allow it to 
interface with other software tools like task management systems. This approach 
could give developers access to the stories directly from their IDE.
\subsection{Version 1 Walkthrough}
To use this system the user is supposed to start by creating a project. Once
created the next step is to create one or more releases, then one or more
sprints, then one or more stories and finally if they choose to they could
create one or more tasks. The only flexibility in this process is the ability to
create stories at any point which are then placed into the backlog. Coverflow
widgets were designed to hold artefacts of the same type. These containers are
initially empty, except for the ability to create a new artefact of that type.
So, to create a project the user could draw a “P” to bring up the project
container. From the container clicking on the New Project button would bring up
a new empty project artefact. This process makes the newly created project
active such that a new release would automatically become a child of this
project. This introduces the concept of the current artefact which is intended
to control the hierarchical structure of the artefacts. For each artefact type,
there could be a current artefact of that type. This allows the system to create
the parent, child relationships of the artefacts automatically. For example once
a project is created, it becomes active and will automatically become the parent
of all newly created artefacts, if however, a second new project is created, it
would then become the new current project and subsequent artefacts would become
the children of this new project. To bring up the releases container one would
use the capital “R” gesture. Again there is a button to create a new release. In
a similar fashion the user can use the gestures outlined in Figure
\ref{Gestures} to bring up the other containers, and create artefacts of those
types. The capital “S” gesture was reserved as a shortcut to skip the story
container and create a new story directly. As each artefact is created it
becomes active and the creation of new artefacts either become siblings or
children of the current artefact. However, if creating siblings these new
artefacts then become the current artefact of this type. For example a User
could go through the process up to creating a sprint, at which point the
creation of many stories may be desirable, and as each one is created, it
becomes current, allowing the optional creation of tasks for that story.
\subsection{Version 2 Design Strategy}
In the course of development the direction that was originally taken came into
question for various reasons. Two important questions arouse as a result of
attending the Surfnet Fall 2010 Workshop \cite{SurfNet}. The first was a
question of flexibility of user interaction with the system and the second was
how might the rigidity of the design adversely affect or interfere with the
human aspects of the process. In an attempt to address these concerns the
original structured implementation was redesigned. The form based approach to
the stories and other artefacts was replaced by a more flexible drawing type
widget which was called a scribble widget. The intent was to allow users to
enter anything they wanted on the cards, imposing no rules; much like the
flexibility afforded them when using physical cards. The scribble widget allowed
the user to scribble notes on the card anywhere as well as provided a mechanism
to do text entry via virtual or real keyboards (see Figure \ref{Scribblecard}
for the illustration). The text entered had the added flexibility of being able
to be reposition anywhere on the card. There was also the ability to erase all
or parts of the information including text. The XML representation of the data
was only slightly modified to allow for these changes. Two new fields were added
to accommodate the new information, including a list of points and text widgets,
the colours, size and positions also needed to be stored. This allowed the data
to be picked up by remote applications and the cards could be re-drawn as
identical copies.

%\end{center}
\end{figure}
\par
\subsection{Version 2 Walkthrough}
The procedure for using the system in version 2 is the same as in version1.
Containers and gestures are still the key elements for accessing and creating
new and existing artefacts. Besides the new scribble widget the only other
change was the ability to create tasks at any point such that tasks and stories
could now be created and stored in the backlog. The biggest change was obviously
the scribble widget which gave the user much more flexibility in the way they
could interact with the artefacts.
\subsection{Design Shortcomings}
The biggest problem with the design of both versions is the rigid imposition of
a hierarchical relationship of the artefacts. The system imposes a top down
approach to the creation of these artefacts. In other words, a Project is first
created, then a release, then a sprint etc. This is very different from the way
it would be done on a real wall; where stories would become part of a sprint or
release by placing them in the appropriate location on the wall. See Future Work
for more detail on this point.
\subsection{How does CMAP comply with Scott’s guidelines for group
collaboration around digital tabletops} 
\subsubsection{Support Interpersonal}
Interactions Collaboration is a communicative process driven by human
interactions and this is supported by CMAP in that the software makes no
deliberate attempts to interfere with this driving force. The success of this
claim would have to be verified by conducting user studies which should reveal
if this is truly the case. In future implementations an attempt to capture this
interaction will be made by integrating the capability to record the planning
session either as a whole or any individual part of the planning meeting
including voice recording controls which can be enabled or disabled on key
artefacts like individual storycards as well as in the shared workspace (the
cardwall).
\subsubsection{Support for fluid Transitions between Activities}
The original CMAP design had no handwriting capabilities and therefore had no
real transitions between different types of user input; although it may have
been fluid it was too rigid for a truly collaborative application. The revised
version allows the user to seamlessly transition between data entry via keyboard
or handwriting. CMAP has built-in support for multiple user input devices via
the PyMT framework. This allows the application to support multiple users
interacting with the system concurrently. For example multiple users could all
be creating and working on different stories at the same time. Multiple users
could technically also edit a story at the same time but, just as with the paper
storycard, the size of these widgets may limit the usefulness of this process.
The PyMT framework also has built-in support for other input devices such as
stylus or even the Wii-remote.
\subsubsection{Support for Transitions between Personal and Group Work}
Transitions between personal and group work will be supported in future versions
of this application. In particular the future work already being considered and
planned for to support these types of transitions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a personal space work widget which will be a modified coverflow. 
   The traditional coverflow widget is static and displays its child artefacts
  as pages in a book which you can flip through page by page. The modified
  coverflow widget will allow the user to transform the widget (scale, rotate
  and move). Each user will have their own coverflow to use as a personal work
  area in which they can create and manage their artefacts in their own personal
  space. The widget must be capable of enabling or disabling a shared view of
  all or part of their widget. By default the widget will be private with the
  user being able to share any part as necessary. The widget will support the
  seamless transition from the current artefact to any adjacent artefact plus
  the ability to quickly jump to an artefact that is physically separated by
  many artefacts. The primary method of sharing artefacts contained in a user’s
  personal coverflow will be to drag the artefact to the shared workspace which
  essentially creates a copy of the artefact in the public domain where it can
  be manipulated by all users. The coverflow will have a smaller scaled view to
  support easier interaction and placement of the contained artefacts into the
  shared workspace as well as the ability to maximize any one artefact in the
  user’s personal workspace.
  \item The primary goal of this shared workspace will be to simulate a story  
  wall where stories are placed and sorted into releases, sprints, etc. Most
  importantly the shared workspace is intended to enhance the collaborative
  experience and facilitate discussion which is a critical component, necessary
  to ensure the success of any Agile based design meeting.\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Support Transitions between Tabletop Collaboration and External
Work} 
Future versions of this software will support a variety of external work inputs 
and outputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow handheld devices to interact and exchange data with the
  application (from cell phones to laptops).
  \item Allow the application to seamlessly allow data import and export to and
  from external applications. This should include other Agile development tools,
  bug trackers, schedulers and task management software. Direct integration into
  the developers IDEs, starting with Eclipse, using Mylyn as a task management
  system is an objective.
  \item The largest benefit of this software may in fact lie in its ability to  
  inter-operate between devices and an ideal setup might in fact be a digital
  table top for group collaboration combined with a wall mounted surface to
  truly give the look and feel of the traditional paper based Agile design
  process.\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Support the use of Physical Objects}
Currently the PyMT Framework supports the use of stylus pens, Wii-remotes and as
stated in the previous point future versions will support the use of other
digital artefacts. Non-work related physical objects are to some degree
supported by the hardware in that many tabletops for example provide a border
where items like drinks or notepads can be placed without interfering with the
application.
\subsubsection{Provide Shared Access to Physical and Digital Objects}
Most of the widgets in the application are rotatable which gives users the
opportunity to use them in any appropriate orientation. When artefacts are in
the shared workspace gestures like pointing should be easily understood and thus
should contribute to the collaborative process. Careful consideration and
further study may reveal to what extend the application needs to support other
types of physical objects.
\subsubsection{Considerations for the Appropriate Arrangements of Users}
The physical size of the table and for future versions, the wall should dictate
the number of users that could comfortably interact with the system. The future
ability to use handheld devices should allow for more simultaneous user
interactions and therefore allow for more participants especially when
interacting around the wall. The only parts of the program that that cannot be
rotated are the menus.  Using these menus may be sensitive to the orientation of
the users. These menus are however, optional since gestures are available to
replace the menu items functionality and the gestures have no orientation. The
rest of the widget as stated previously can be rotated to suit the needs of the
users. For future versions where the personal workspace is implemented there
will need to be careful consideration as to how the system reacts when people
physically change their positions around the workspace. One simple solution
might be similar to what might happen in a real meeting. For example, in a
traditional pen and paper style meeting the task at hand requires that you
change your position for whatever reason and you forget to bring all your
personal stuff it may be reasonable to simply ask someone to pass your things to
you; since all the artefacts are draggable this could easily be accomplished by
the CMAP.
\subsubsection{Support Simultaneous User Actions}
The support for simultaneous user actions is limited only by the hardware since
the PyMT framework gives the application support for any number simultaneous
user actions. This support is of utmost importance to the success of any
software designed to support co-located group collaboration.
\subsection{Distributed Agile Teams}
Although for the most part distributed Agile team support is out of scope for
the project, it is however supported in a limited fashion. This support includes
the ability to work using the application in different locations and when data
is saved it will be available to all applications that have registers with the
Google app server. Registration with the Google App server is dependent on this
feature being enabled via the configuration file or the corresponding command
line argument. While not real time collaboration is does gives distributed team
the ability to share their artefacts.\section{Implementation}
This seqction provides a brief description of the major elements implemented in
CMAP. It is a companion to the sequence diagrams that describe how CMAP works.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Storyboot: The entry point for the application, it manages orderly 
  start-up and shutdown.
  \item AgiConfig: Creates the configuration from a set of configuration files
  and command line arguments and makes this information available to other
  components.
  \item Console Logger: Provides configurable logging services to the 
  application 
  \item Async: Provides non-blocking access to the Collaboration Server and the 
  Git Manager. 
  \item PyMT: The multitouch framework provides windowing services, manages I/O
  with multitouch devices, maps them into a uniform interface, and integrates
  keyboards (physical and virtual) and mice onto the standard interface. •  
  StoryApp: The main application controller. It manages the main PyMT window and
  serves as a container for all application containers such as coverflows,
  menus, lists etc. •   MTWindow: The main PyMT window. All drawing occurs here
  or a child of this widget.
  \item MTCoverflow: The primary container, used to hold application artefacts
  in CMAP.
  \item ArtifactController: The base class for all CMAP artefacts. Provides the
  controller element of the Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern.
  Functions as the public interface to artefact data and provides the control
  logic for all displayable artefacts.
  \item BaseModel: The base class for the model element of the MVC design
  pattern. Encapsulates the data for an artefact and interfaces with Document
  Object Model.
  \item GitManager: Interface to the GIT repository, it abstracts away all the
  complexities of using Git and allows Git to be accessed in an non-blocking
  manner.
  \item ServerManager: Provides an HTTP server that listens for notification
  messages about file changes from GitHub via the Collaboration Server hosted on
  Google.
  \item ToCollaboration: Provides subscribe and unsubscribe services to the
  Collaboration Server.
  \item Collaboration Server: Implemented as a Google App Engine application
  hosted on Google. Provides publish/subscribe and store and forward services to
  CMAP. Currently allows CMAP users in a team to receive file change
  notification messages from GitHub in real time or at subscribe time.
\end{itemize} 

Figure \ref{ClientServer} is shows the relationships between the StoryApp controller and
the local GIT repository, the GitHub server and the Google App Server.\begin{figure}[htp]

\end{figure}
Beside the artefacts previously discussed in the design section the next most
important widget used for interaction with the system are the containers that
hold like artefacts. For this purpose a coverflow was chosen because of its
ability to flip through its pages, where the pages of our coverflow widgets are
buttons representing existing artefacts and a default button to create a new
artefact. The coverflow widget was customized so that the users could drag them
around as well as do the standard coverflow stuff like flip through the pages
and interact with the current page by selecting it. Figure \ref{Coverflow} 
outlines the flow of populating a coverflow with artefacts.\begin{figure}[htp]

Figure \ref{Collaboration} shows the sequence of subscribing and unsubscribing
with the Google App Server as well the notifications sent from the GitHub server
to the Google App Server and the subsequent messages sent to each subscriber.
The final loop in this sequence diagram outlines what the StoryApp controller
would do to update the artefacts. Unfortunately due to time constraints this was
not implemented but there is a skeleton function in the StoryApp controller
ready to do what the diagram depicts.

Figure \ref{Save} shows the data flow of a save operation including alternate
paths it might take depending on the availability of the services like the local
repository. It also highlights the fact the save will automatically traverse the
chain of children and parents to update all artefact affected by the change.

\subsection{The PyMT Multitouch Framework} 
We used PyMT framework because PyMT supports many input devices as well
concurrent use of these devices. It has a rich library of widgets and support
for gestures. Since it is an open source framework, any extensions or
modifications needed could be easily applied. It clearly provided many highly
useful features but, most importantly, because it is platform and operating
system independent, it gave us the ability to run the app on a variety of
hardware available to us in the lab. It needed to work on both our 23 and 24
inch Dell and Acer two touch monitors. This support was crucial so we could
easily test as we coded. We also needed it run on out Smart Technologies Ltd.
FTIR table and on our custom built DI (Diffused Illumination \cite{DI}) table. 
The PyMT multitouch framework is still in beta but is well on its way to
becoming an extremely useful tool for developing GUI interfaces for multitouch
enabled hardware. It is in continuous active development and lead by a strong
team leader and he has what appears to be a truly motivated team judging by the
amount of activity in the project’s repository. They have a good support system
and are quick to answer questions and provide feedback. They are also quite
willing to accept fixes and often will apply a patch to their master repository
within a few hours of having request to pull. There are, however, challenges
when using any beta product. This combined with my lack of experience developing
user interfaces and GUI applications meant that there was far too much time
debugging code thinking that it was a lack of understanding when in reality it
was a bug in the framework. A developer more experienced in these areas would
have been able to spot the difference. That being said it does have a rich
library of useful widgets and is particularly good at providing the developer
the means to truly showcase the multitouch capabilities of the system. There are
probably two main weaknesses in this framework. The first is its support for
text editing. While it does support text editing using real or virtual
keyboards, it does not give you the functionality we all take for granted when
dealing with text. This is actually an area that they are currently working on
improving and have just recently, in the 0.52 development branch added the
capability to select text, copy and paste it. This functionality is however not
ready for production and does work as you would expect. The second problem and
this admittedly may stem from my lack of experience in this type of programing
but it seems that their layout and layout management is quite fragile and hard
to use. This could be supported by the fact that they complete re-wrote their
base layout class for the official release of 0.51. Overall the benefits of PyMT
truly outweigh the disadvantages and there are absolutely no regrets as to the
choice made to use this framework.


\subsection{Status}
CMAP accomplished many goals but still fell short in some areas for various
reasons to be discussed later in this section. What was accomplished was the
ability to use and collaborate around a multitouch enabled surface in an
intuitive flexible manner.
\subsubsection{Key Features Fully implemented in CMAP}
\begin{itemize}   
  \item Full support for multiple concurrent inputs, limited only by the  
  hardware. By using the PyMT framework we were able to provide this without any
  extra code. 
  \item Support for multiple operating systems. Since the system is
   implemented in Python using the PyMT framework and both Python and PyMT are
   platform independent, this gives us the flexibility to run on many
   hardware devices. One example is that we were able to use CMAP on a
   tabletop designed by Smart Technologies without using the SMART SDK, instead
   we installed an open source package CCV (Community Core Vision) which was
   able to interface with sensor camera and output the touch event as defined by
   the TUIO protocol (Tangible User Interface Objects), which is supported by
   PyMT. 
  \item Ability to create and manage many aspects of a project in an Agile
  manner. The system supports the hierarchical creation of different
  artefacts. Users can define projects and for each project they can create
  releases, for each release they can create sprints, for each sprint they can
  create stories and finally for each story they can create tasks. 
  \item Flexibility is provided by the fact that users can choose to only deal 
  with stories and are not forced to create any higher level artefacts like
  projects, releases and sprints. This mimics the real use of storycards at the
  start of a new project. Also the new interface gives the user complete
  flexibility in terms of how and where they enter data as well as the format,
  i.e. supports handwriting, printing or keyboard text entry. 
  \item Ability to use gestures to create and interact with all artefacts.  
  Although there are menus that give access to these same features, the menus
  are orientation sensitive while the gestures have no orientation. Also all
  the artefacts can be rotated to suit the needs of the users. The use of
  gestures is important in a system trying to eliminate orientation issues. 
  \item Shared data is supported by the ability to commit to a local repository
   which in turn triggers a notification in the form of a pull request to other
   remote applications. 
  \item Fully configurable to allow for on or offline line use or any
   combination of features. Full point to point collaboration commits changes to
   the local Git repository which pushes to the GitHub server which triggers a
   notification to be sent to the Google App Server to notify any other
   applications registered with the Google App Server that they should pull from
   the GitHub server. \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Key Features Partially Implemented}
\begin{itemize}   
  \item One of the most important features of the combined use of the
   traditional Storycard and cardwall is the use and organization of the stories
   on the cardwall. The system, as implemented, does allows users the
   flexibility to place the stories anywhere on the wall; however it lacks any
   ability to infer information from the placement of these stories. On a real
   world cardwall, the placement of cards and their relationship to other cards
   has meaning. The software needs the ability to infer the hierarchical
   structure of the artefacts simply based on their position and proximity to
   other artefacts. For this to work the system would have to be able to learn
   the way individual teams work so as to get these relationships correct.
  \item Real-time collaboration is partially implemented. When artefacts are
   saved to the local repository and the registration with the Google App Server
   has been enabled via the configuration file or command line option; the
   remote application(s) receive the request to pull. On successful completion
   of the pull there is a skeleton method that needs to be implemented that
   receives a list of files that need to be updated or added. Each file in the
   list is actually an XML representation of an artefact.
  \item In favour of performance the system currently on pushes to the GitHub
   server on exit. This means that concurrent remote system must restart in
   order to get updates from other systems. As a prototype this may be
   acceptable however, as a production system this mechanism would need to be
   revised. One possible piece of this solution would be to replace the use of
   GitHub and Google App servers with servers hosted in house. This would avoid
   excess network traffic on systems that were not designed for constant
  real-time updates. \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Key Features Not Implemented}
\begin{itemize}   
  \item Probably the most important feature not implemented is the flexibility
   to assign type to any artefact at any time. This is normally done by
   organising stories on the wall such that their placement is what signifies
   their relationship to other artefacts. It is extremely important to add this
   functionality to the system. Among other techniques dragging one artefact and
   release it on another should create this relationship as well as sorting the
   artefacts on the wall (this would require that the system understands team
   specific layouts)
  \item Real-time editing of artefacts should be supported so that changes to
   artefacts are seen in real-time on remote systems. This includes the
   implementation of the hook in the StoryApp controller to update the artefacts
   and add new ones.
  \item Ability to identify which artefacts as current for each type.
  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion}
\subsubsection{Lessons Learned}
This project became an excellent lesson in the dangers of using too many new
technologies all at once. The following were all new at the start of the
project.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Python programming language 
  \item The PyMT multitouch framework 
  \item The principles of Agile methodologies 
  \item GUI interface design and lack of GUI programming experience 
\end{itemize}
In the end, the novelties associated with multitouch concepts became only a
small portion of the new material that had to be digested to bring the project
to a successful conclusion. The following discussion reflects on the impact of
each technology on the success of the project. Because the use of the Python
programming language was completely new it was a challenge to write good, clear
reusable object oriented code. In particular, many practices traditionally
considered important in the object oriented paradigm, like programming to
interfaces and the use of composition over inheritance, were not as clear when
using Python, instead of a more familiar language like Java. To start with
Python intentionally has no direct support for what might be considered an
interface; instead similar functionality is obtained through the use of abstract
classes from which you inherit. Being force to inheritance in this way cause
some confusion about when composition could be used over inheritance. But the
dynamic nature of the language proved to be extremely useful as it allowed us to
construct our artefacts from XML files including adding new attributes and this
capability will be key to allowing the customization of the artefacts by the end
users. The on-going learning process of the Agile methodology was in many
respects an advantage for the development of a system that was trying to
digitise and capture this behaviour. This meant that the upfront planning by the
very nature of the knowledge base being drawn from was quite brief and only
enough to get a general idea of the scope of the project. As more was understood
about the process these revelations found themselves being applied throughout
the course of development in subsequent iterations as well as during
refactoring. Problems aside the lessons learned and the accumulated knowledge
gained through the course of this project were invaluable and overall it was an
incredible experience.
\subsubsection{New Features For Future Versions}
Many enhancements could be made to the system such as the following list of
features that will be added to CMAP in subsequent versions
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system must have an out of the box default behaviour that is
   intuitive and useful but it also needs to provide teams with the flexibility
   of adapting it to fit their particular process. Any method particular to a
   team should be configurable and supported by CMAP. This may include the
   team’s use of color, symbols and notation and possibly other(s). All the
   things that they do that may convey additional meaning to users familiar with
   their system should be easily integrated into CMAP. We need the ability for
   the user to define all of this notation such that for example a scribble or
   text of a certain color might signify to the system that what is being
   written is a “benefit’ or a “As a”, “Want to” or “So that” type of field.
   Likewise a certain symbol placed on the card could signify that this artefact
   is in progress, assigned etc. This flexibility is important but at the same
   time it should be up to the user to decide if they want to use this
   capability and not force it on the users. That being said, we must remember
   that the more the system understands the meaning of the content the more
   useful the digitization of the system becomes, especially in terms of
   overhead and duplication of work.
  \item The storycards themselves should have a way to be flipped such that the
   back of the card is usable and maybe a way to simultaneously view both back
   and front of any one artefact. 
  \item Default templates to allow users to base their artefacts on a predefined
   structure should be supported. These templates should support customization
   similar to what was already discussed to support changes in the way team
   wants to use the artefacts. Different templates based on difference in common
   uses of the cards from different Agile methodologies would be a good start. 
  \item If the users are using a template and or have defined any notation, then
   they should be able to switch between a structured and non-structured view of
   the cards (scribble vs. form type views). 
  \item Each card needs the ability to record audio to try and capture the social
   interaction and intent of each story. 
  \item Similarly, the whiteboard or wall should have its own flexible recording
   capabilities to capture the interaction during the sorting, prioritization
   and scheduling of the stories. 
  \item Ideally a collaborative type group area like a digital table, combined
   with an information radiator like a digital wallboard as well as the ability
   to toss stories onto the wall or table from other portable devices or remote
   computers.
  \item The recognition of handwriting is critical in order to interface and
   exchange data with other tools.
  \item Size matters; the cards must not be re-sizable other then maybe the
   ability to see both sides simultaneously as previously mentioned. The
   physical size ensures a true communicative process and dialog between
   developers and customers (although we still want to be able rotate and
  obviously move them).
    
\end{itemize} 


\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Innovations and Contributions}
There are a few aspects of this project that could be considered as
contributions to computer science. Most noticeably is a proof of concept that
large multitouch surfaces can be leveraged to support dynamic, team
collaboration in collocated and distributed environments. Multitouch enabled
hardware and software provides a new interface that is very well suited for
group collaboration and gives developers of collaborative design software the
tools needed to address many of points outline in Scott’s paper on the
guidelines for group collaboration around a digital tabletop. CMAP provides an
open source platform independent framework that can be used to develop and test
further concepts in co-located and distributed collaboration. These concepts can
be tested on any number of multitouch enabled hardware devices. This flexibility
is important for future study aimed at establishing guidelines for the best
combination of size, resolution, number of concurrent touch inputs and shape of
future multitouch devices for the express purpose of group collaboration in a
design setting. The novel use of the distributed code repository may also be
considered important; it demonstrated a clean reusable solution to the difficult
problem of sharing versioned data and the possibility to remotely collaborate
using the shared distributed repository. A number of important lessons were
learned during the development and use of the two versions of CMAP. The most
important is to consider the relations between the physical actions being
performed and the cognitive processes that facilitate the activity. A user that
picks up a storycard from a backlog pile and places it on a pile for a
particular sprint is hopefully thinking "I am scheduling this story into that
sprint" rather than "this is how I move this card to that pile". It is important
that the physical gestures not interfere with the flow of thought. Far too often
in computer based systems this is not the case and the necessity to perform
several computer interactions to execute a seemingly simple operation interrupts
the train of thought. A rigorous re-examination of how we interact physically
with the computer is needed to eliminate distracting computer operations.
\subsection{Future Work}
CMAP can be used as a starting point for future study. Of particular interest
would be to conduct user studies to observe its usefulness in a real world
project development process in both collocated and distributed teams. Further
development of the application could then be explored, implementing the results
of those findings combined with the continued development of the system with the
addition of the features outlined in the Implementation section. Further
exploration of improvements needed for the real-time collaboration in
distributed teams is critical for the system to be successfully integrated as a
widespread tool in industry. Furthermore, there needs to be more exploration
with respect to the potential use of 3D graphics in conjunction with multitouch.
PyMT is fully OpenGL compatible and will permit the exploration of rich
alternatives to existing means of interaction.
\subsection{Closing Remarks}
As software engineers and developers we are constantly presented with the
opportunity of creating software intended to replace activities traditionally
performed using pen and paper. Although our ability to design and implement
these systems is improving, we still tend to fall short more often than not.
“Research has shown that the versatility of paper contributes to its persistent
use in many work environments, even along-side computers meant to replace
it\special{(Luff et al., 1992)}.” \cite{ScottGuidelines} Key factors that
contribute to this failure have been outlined in this paper. Most important is
the flexibility of the system, and the human factors that make the activity a
success. The digitization of tasks must consider the communication, mediation
and human interactions that are inherent in the tasks, and must be designed in a
way to encourage or enhance these interactions (or at the very least, not
interfere with them).
