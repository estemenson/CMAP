\subsection{Sumary: Information Visualization\cite{Gershon:1998:Informationvisualization}}
This paper explains that a visualization is a technique used to display
information in a graphical or visual manner with the intent of leveraging our 
natural visual capabilities. Visualization allows us to process, analyse and
understands massive amounst of data very quickly. The problem with
visualizations is that we are trying to use them, to quickly understand more and
more abstract data, that does not always have an immediately obvious mapping to
the real world. This presents a challange in trying to develop reusable
meaningful visualisations. There is ongoing reasearch to try and leverage
metaphors and to try understand what type of analytic tasks could be enhance by
visualizations based on those metaphors.

The paper talks about visualization developments in several areas including,
document and software visualiztion, distortion techniques, hierarchies, data
integration (including datawharehousing and data mining) and world wide web. 
At the time of publication of this paper in the late 90's there was also some
real world commercial applications including applications based on work done at
Xerox PARC including Perspective Wall, Cone Tree and Wide Widgets.

The author suggests that, at the time, there was still much work to be done
in terms of understanding the potential and usefullness of the technology but it
was clear that visualizations would play a huge role in the future of computing.
Gershon describes visualization as an immerging discipline which must progress
through four fundamental stages and suggests that visualization is progressing
at an accelerated pace because many of the step are are being progressing in
parallel; ``An emerging discipline progresses through four stages. First, it
starts as a craft, practiced by artisans using heuristics. Second, researchers
formulate scientific principles and theories to gain insights about the
processes. Third, engineers eventually refine these principles and insights
into production rules. Fourth, the technology becomes widely available.''

The paper describes that widespread usefulness of visualizations will be
directly influenced by the content providers' (software design and developers)
ability to create visualizations that are accessible and easily understood by
a wide range of end users, making them equaliy useful for users of diverse
backgrounds. In order to create these meaningful visualizations in real world
applications the systems being modeled and the processes envolved must be
understood. This understanding in itself could lead to the correct visualization
for any particular task. 

There ate many areas that we need to learn more about in order to better
support human learning throuch visulizations like what types of interactions
make sense for any particular visualization, how we perceive and
understand information both visually and nonvsually as well as how we search
for information and how we adapt those searches based on previous knowledge. A
better understanding of these issues and how they relate to specific analylict 
tasks will inform the creation or more usefull, meaningfull visualisations that 
that can truly help end users process more data more acuratelly and quicker. The
ability to create more flexible task oriented user interfaces can also aid in
the development more useful visualizations.

An important point that Gershon makes in the paper is that we also need to
understand when graphic visualization may infact be less appropriate. In fact
sometimes a visualization may be harder to understand than words; we need to
weigh the options and choose the representation that is most appropriate to
allow the users to accomplish the required task.

In conclusion the paper re-iterates that there is great need for the evolution
of this emerging technology especially in ``The development of scientific and
engineering principles for the generation of visualizations  (to users with
diverse needs and capabilities) and a methodology for solving problems with
information visualization are badly needed.''

\subsection{Sumary: Beyond Models and Metaphors: Visual Formalisms in User
Interface Design\cite{Nardi:BeyondModels}}
\subsubsection{Sumary}
In this paper they argue that the user interface can be designed to support
the visual representation of the underlying program's semantics and can help
offload cognitive load to facilitate problem solving. Nardi postulates that at
the time this paper was published in the early 90's it was time to start
focusing more attention on the semantic interface rather then the also
important but less interesting supply of user commands to the underlying
application. She claims that design and analysis tasks are complex and software
designed to support these activities would be enhanced with well designed
visual interface from which the semantics of the application could be easily
inferred by the users. The designers of this type of complex application would
be well served to have a toolkit of computational building blocks, such that
they could piece together the appropriate blocks which could support this
visual transfer of application semantics.

Nardi argues that neither Mental models nor Metaphors are appropriate
theoretical foundations to support such  building blocks but that these blocks
could be developed by leveraging the power of visual formalisms. She argues
that different visual formalisms can be used as the building blocks for
semantic interfaces and showed how a table or grid visual formalism was
implemented and explains the potential for it to be used as a building block.

\subsection{Sumary: A Collaborative Dimensions Framework: Understanding the Mediating Role of Conceptual Visualizations in Collaborative Knowledge Work}
This paper describes how conceptual visualizations can be used as cognitive
artefacts that support collaborative knowledge work. The paper attempts to
combine the cognitive dimensions of notations framework \cite{Blackwell:NotationalSystems} ,
communicative dimensions framework 
\cite{Hundhausen:CommunicativeDimensionsFramework} and work on the boundary
object paradigm \cite{Star:BoundaryObjects} to inform the creation of a tool
used for the description of collaborative visualizations for knowledge work.
