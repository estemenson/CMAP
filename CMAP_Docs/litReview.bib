abstract={The user interface has both syntactic functions-supplying commands and arguments to programs-and semantic functions-visually presenting application semantics and supporting problem solving cognition. The authors argue that though both functions are important, it is time to devote more resources to the problems of the semantic interface. Complex problem solving activities, e.g. for design and analysis tasks, benefit from clear visualizations of application semantics in the user interface. Designing the semantic interface requires computational building blocks capable of representing and visually presenting application semantics in a clear, precise way. The authors argue that neither mental models not metaphors provide a basis for designing and implementing such building blocks, but that visual formalisms do. They compare the benefits of mental models, metaphors and visual formalisms as the basis for designing the user interface, with particular attention to the practical solutions each provides to application developers},

abstract={Distributed collaboration is an emerging technology for the 21st century that will significantly change how business is conducted in the defense and commercial sectors. Collaboration involves two or more geographically dispersed individuals working together to share and exchange data, information, knowledge, and actions. The product of the collaboration is defined broadly to include, for example, writing a report, creating software, designing hardware, or developing an alternative course of action for the commander. Distributed collaborative environments (DCE) provide the framework and integrate models, simulations, domain specific tools, and virtual test beds to facilitate collaboration between the multiple disciplines needed in the enterprise. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is conducting a leading edge program in developing distributed collaborative technologies targeted to the Air Force's implementation of a simulation-aided acquisition and test process, distributed mission training, and distributed command and control. Geographically separated teams of government and industry engineers, scientists, managers, and procurement specialists will be able to jointly develop advanced technology products. The team will be able to access widely distributed computer-based engineering tools, models and simulations, databases, and research facilities. DCE will reduce the cost of development and ownership, reduce duplication of effort, improve quality of design, and result in faster time to product. The research is focusing on the open standards agent-based framework, product and process modelling, structural architecture, and the integration technologies-the glue to integrate the software components. DCE is the underlying infrastructure that makes communication between the diverse simulations and other assets possible and manages the overall flow of the experiment. The AFRL Collaborative Environment concept will foster a major cultural change in how the acquisition, training, and operational communities conduct business},

pages={1073-1080}, 
abstract={A great corpus of studies reports empirical evidence of how information visualization supports comprehension and analysis of data. The benefits of visualization for synchronous group knowledge work, however, have not been addressed extensively. Anecdotal evidence and use cases illustrate the benefits of synchronous collaborative information visualization, but very few empirical studies have rigorously examined the impact of visualization on group knowledge work. We have consequently designed and conducted an experiment in which we have analyzed the impact of visualization on knowledge sharing in situated work groups. Our experimental study consists of evaluating the performance of 131 subjects (all experienced managers) in groups of 5 (for a total of 26 groups), working together on a real-life knowledge sharing task. We compare (1) the control condition (no visualization provided), with two visualization supports: (2) optimal and (3) suboptimal visualization (based on a previous survey). The facilitator of each group was asked to populate the provided interactive visual template with insights from the group, and to organize the contributions according to the group consensus. We have evaluated the results through both objective and subjective measures. Our statistical analysis clearly shows that interactive visualization has a statistically significant, objective and positive impact on the outcomes of knowledge sharing, but that the subjects seem not to be aware of this. In particular, groups supported by visualization achieved higher productivity, higher quality of outcome and greater knowledge gains. No statistically significant results could be found between an optimal and a suboptimal visualization though (as classified by the pre-experiment survey). Subjects also did not seem to be aware of the benefits that the visualizations provided as no difference between the visualization and the control conditions was found for the self-reported measures of satisfaction a- - nd participation. An implication of our study for information visualization applications is to extend them by using real-time group annotation functionalities that aid in the group sense making process of the represented data.},

In this paper we explore how conceptual visualizations (such as diagrams, visual metaphors, charts, sketches) can be constructed and used as cognitive artefacts that support collaborative knowledge work. In order to facilitate tasks such as the creation and sharing of knowledge in teams, we propose a collaborative dimensions framework as a tool for understanding how visual artefacts can facilitate collaboration in circumstances that involve distributed knowledge. The framework is based on the widespread Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework and is enriched with criteria from the boundary object paradigm discussed in organization science. The dimensions of the framework are described and then applied to three different visualizations that are used in collaborative knowledge work. A discussion of future research needs concludes the paper.},

abstract={Task-specific application development environments enable end users to create their own applications. This is advantageous in two ways: users can draw on their own rich task knowledge to create the applications they really want, and reliance on the scarce, expensive expertise of professional programmers is greatly reduced. Extensible systems such as spreadsheets and statistical packages provide a good model for application construction as they allow end users to create complete applications. Such environments eliminate the need for separate user interface builders; the interface is seamlessly created as the application is developed. In this `Zen' process, there is little difference between application development and user interface development. Further barriers are broken down by creating application development components that can continually be edited and refined, so that distinctions among `editing', `building', `application construction', and `finished application' begin to disappear. The authors describe ACE, an architecture for building task-specific applications, and the software libraries they have developed to implement this architecture. They show how ACE supports the building of task-specific applications via a range of extension mechanisms from interactive editing by end users to programmer-defined subclassing},

Visualization is a powerful tool for analyzing data and presenting results in science, engineering and medicine. This paper reviews ways in which it can be used in distributed and/or collaborative environments. Distributed visualization addresses a number of resource allocation problems, including the location of processing close to data for the minimization of data traffic. The advent of the Grid Computing paradigm and the link to Web Services provides fresh challenges and opportunities for distributed visualizationâincluding the close coupling of simulations and visualizations in a steering environment. Recent developments in collaboration have seen the growth of specialized facilities (such as Access Grid) which have supplemented traditional desktop video conferencing using the Internet and multicast communications. Collaboration allows multiple usersâpossibly at remote sitesâto take part in the visualization process at levels which range from the viewing of images to the shared control of the visualization methods. In this review, we present a model framework for distributed and collaborative visualization and assess a selection of visualization systems and frameworks for their use in a distributed or collaborative environment. We also discuss some examples of enabling technology and review recent work from research projects in this field.},

abstract = {
Recent discussion has resolved the question of how prior knowledge organizes new learning into the technical definition and study of "metaphor". Some theorists have adopted an "operational" approach, focusing on the manifest effects of suggesting metaphoric comparisons to learners. Some have resolved the question formally into a "structural" definition of metaphor. However, structural and operation approaches typically ignore the goal-directed learner-initiated learning process through which metaphors become relevant and effective in learning. Taking this process seriously affords an analysis of metaphor that explains why metaphors are intrinsically open-ended and how their open-endedness stimulates the construction of mental models.}

abstract ={
               Scientific work is heterogeneous, requiring many different actors and viewpoints. It also requires cooperation. The two create tension between divergent viewpoints and the need for generalizable findings. We present a model of how one group of actors managed this tension. It draws on the work of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of `boundary objects'. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.

abstract={ The field of information visualization offers little methodological guidance to practitioners who seek to design novel systems. Though many sources describe the foundations of the domain, few discuss practical methods for solving visualization problems. One frequently cited guideline to design is the "Visual information-seeking mantra", proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Although often used to inform the design of information visualization systems, it is unclear what use this has been for visualization designers. We reviewed the current literature that references the mantra, noting what authors have found useful about it and why they cite it. The results indicate a need for empirical validation of the mantra and for a method, such as design patterns, to inform a holistic approach to visualisation design.},

It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of this paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique for visual programming environments. We apply it to two commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful in achieving a good [`]closeness of match', but designers need to consider the [`]viscosity ' (resistance to local change) and the [`]secondary notation' (possibility of conveying extra meaning by choice of layout, colour, etc.)."}

Research was conducted at a major airline to investigate factors related to situation awareness in aviation maintenance teams. Situation awareness has been found to be critical to performance and error prevention in many environments. Its role in the maintenance domain for the performance of both individuals and teams is discussed. Situation awareness requirements for aviation maintenance were determined as well as the technologies and personnel resources used to achieve situation awareness. Barriers and problems for situation awareness both across and within teams involved in aviation maintenance were revealed. Based on this analysis, recommendations for the development of a training program to improve situation awareness in aircraft maintenance at the individual and team level are presented.
Relevance to industry
The importance of situation awareness for preventing errors in maintenance is discussed as well as factors that contribute to problems with situation awareness across multiple teams. Specific recommendations for improving situation awareness through organization and system design and through training are made that are applicable to a wide variety of industrial settings."
